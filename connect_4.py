"""
Full code for running a game of connect 4 on a board_width, board_height and winning length can be specified in relevant
methods. Allowing you to play connect 5, 6, 7, etc. Defaults are board_width = 7, board_height = 6, winning_length = 4

The main method to use here is play_game which simulates a game to the end using the function args it takes to determine
where each player plays.
The board is represented by a board_width x board_height tuple of ints. A 0 means no player has played in a space, 1
means player one has played there, -1 means the seconds player has played there. The apply_move method can be used to
return a copy of a given state with a given move applied. This can be useful for doing min-max or monte carlo sampling.
